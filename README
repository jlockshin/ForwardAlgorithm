Running forward.py:

From the commandline, navigate to the directory where forward.py is located.

Run the program with the following arguments on the commandline:

'python forward.py -n <number of regular states> -s <sequence> -e (emission_file) -t <transition_file>''

Where:
-n is an integer (number of regular, non-silent states)
-s is a sequence of A, C, G, T
-e is a txt file with emission probabilities
-t is a txt file with transition probabilities (it is assumed that 0 is the begin state and n + 1 is the end state)

Example input:
python forward.py -n 2 -s TAGA -e emission_file.txt -t transition_file.txt
